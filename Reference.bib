abstract  ="Multicomponent systems are ubiquitous in nature and industry. While the physics of few-component liquid mixtures (i.e.{,} binary and ternary ones) is well-understood and routinely taught in undergraduate courses{,} the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of N-component mixtures with N > 3 have remained relatively unexplored. An example of such a mixture is provided by the intracellular fluid{,} in which protein-rich droplets phase separate into distinct membraneless organelles. In this work{,} we investigate equilibrium phase behavior and morphology of N-component liquid mixtures within the Flory–Huggins theory of regular solutions. In order to determine the number of coexisting phases and their compositions{,} we developed a new algorithm for constructing complete phase diagrams{,} based on numerical convexification of the discretized free energy landscape. Together with a Cahn–Hilliard approach for kinetics{,} we employ this method to study mixtures with N = 4 and 5 components. We report on both the coarsening behavior of such systems{,} as well as the resulting morphologies in three spatial dimensions. We discuss how the number of coexisting phases and their compositions can be extracted with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering algorithms. Finally, we discuss how one can reverse engineer the interaction parameters and volume fractions of components in order to achieve a range of desired packing structures{,} such as nested “Russian dolls” and encapsulated Janus droplets."}

number={6},
pages={1286-1298},
abstract={Summary Heat causes protein misfolding and aggregation and, in eukaryotic cells, triggers aggregation of proteins and RNA into stress granules. We have carried out extensive proteomic studies to quantify heat-triggered aggregation and subsequent disaggregation in budding yeast, identifying >170 endogenous proteins aggregating within minutes of heat shock in multiple subcellular compartments. We demonstrate that these aggregated proteins are not misfolded and destined for degradation. Stable-isotope labeling reveals that even severely aggregated endogenous proteins are disaggregated without degradation during recovery from shock, contrasting with the rapid degradation observed for many exogenous thermolabile proteins. Although aggregation likely inactivates many cellular proteins, in the case of a heterotrimeric aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex, the aggregated proteins remain active with unaltered fidelity. We propose that most heat-induced aggregation of mature proteins reflects the operation of an adaptive, autoregulatory process of functionally significant aggregate assembly and disassembly that aids cellular adaptation to thermal stress.},

abstract={Liquid--liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an important mechanism that helps explain the membraneless compartmentalization of the nucleus. Because chromatin compaction and LLPS are collective phenomena, linking their modulation to the physicochemical features of nucleosomes is challenging. Here, we develop an advanced multiscale chromatin model---integrating atomistic representations, a chemically-specific coarse-grained model, and a minimal model---to resolve individual nucleosomes within sub-Mb chromatin domains and phase-separated systems. To overcome the difficulty of sampling chromatin at high resolution, we devise a transferable enhanced-sampling Debye-length replica-exchange molecular dynamics approach. We find that nucleosome thermal fluctuations become significant at physiological salt concentrations and destabilize the 30-nm fiber. Our simulations show that nucleosome breathing favors stochastic folding of chromatin and promotes LLPS by simultaneously boosting the transient nature and heterogeneity of nucleosome--nucleosome contacts, and the effective nucleosome valency. Our work puts forward the intrinsic plasticity of nucleosomes as a key element in the liquid-like behavior of nucleosomes within chromatin, and the regulation of chromatin LLPS.},

When droplets have grown in a polymer network with a stiffness gradient{,} droplets in relatively stiff regions of the network tend to dissolve{,} favoring growth of droplets in softer regions. Here{,} we show that this elastic ripening can be strong enough to reverse the direction of Ostwald ripening: large droplets can shrink to feed the growth of smaller ones. To numerically model these experiments{,} we generalize the theory of elastic ripening to account for gradients in solubility alongside gradients in mechanical stiffness."}

abstract = {Abstract TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein active in splicing that concentrates into membraneless ribonucleoprotein granules and forms aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease. Although best known for its predominantly disordered C-terminal domain which mediates ALS inclusions, TDP-43 has a globular N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we show that TDP-43 NTD assembles into head-to-tail linear chains and that phosphomimetic substitution at S48 disrupts TDP-43 polymeric assembly, discourages liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro, fluidizes liquid–liquid phase separated nuclear TDP-43 reporter constructs in cells, and disrupts RNA splicing activity. Finally, we present the solution NMR structure of a head-to-tail NTD dimer comprised of two engineered variants that allow saturation of the native polymerization interface while disrupting higher-order polymerization. These data provide structural detail for the established mechanistic role of the well-folded TDP-43 NTD in splicing and link this function to LLPS. In addition, the fusion-tag solubilized, recombinant form of TDP-43 full-length protein developed here will enable future phase separation and in vitro biochemical assays on TDP-43 function and interactions that have been hampered in the past by TDP-43 aggregation.},

    abstract = { Eukaryote cells have flexible membranes that allow them to have a variety of dynamical shapes. The shapes of the cells serve important biological functions, both for cells within an intact tissue, and during embryogenesis and cellular motility. How cells control their shapes and the structures that they form on their surface has been a subject of intensive biological research, exposing the building blocks that cells use to deform their membranes. These processes have also drawn the interest of theoretical physicists, aiming to develop models based on physics, chemistry and nonlinear dynamics. Such models explore quantitatively different possible mechanisms that the cells can employ to initiate the spontaneous formation of shapes and patterns on their membranes. We review here theoretical work where one such class of mechanisms was investigated: the coupling between curved membrane proteins, and the cytoskeletal forces that they recruit. Theory indicates that this coupling gives rise to a rich variety of membrane shapes and dynamics, while experiments indicate that this mechanism appears to drive many cellular shape changes. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Self-organization in cell biology’. }

abstract = {For most intracellular structures with larger than molecular dimensions, little is known about the connection between underlying molecular activities and higher order organization such as size and shape. Here, we show that both the size and shape of the amphibian oocyte nucleolus ultimately arise because nucleoli behave as liquid-like droplets of RNA and protein, exhibiting characteristic viscous fluid dynamics even on timescales of \&lt;\&nbsp;1\&nbsp;min. We use these dynamics to determine an apparent nucleolar viscosity, and we show that this viscosity is ATP-dependent, suggesting a role for active processes in fluidizing internal contents. Nucleolar surface tension and fluidity cause their restructuring into spherical droplets upon imposed mechanical deformations. Nucleoli exhibit a broad distribution of sizes with a characteristic power law, which we show is a consequence of spontaneous coalescence events. These results have implications for the function of nucleoli in ribosome subunit processing and provide a physical link between activity within a macromolecular assembly and its physical properties on larger length scales.}}

abstract  ="Liquid droplets embedded in soft solids are a new composite material whose properties are not very well explored. In particular{,} it is unclear how the elastic properties of the matrix affect the dynamics of the droplets. Here{,} we study theoretically how stiffness gradients influence droplet growth and arrangement. We show that stiffness gradients imply concentration gradients in the dilute phase{,} which transport droplet material from stiff to soft regions. Consequently{,} droplets dissolve in the stiff region{,} creating a dissolution front. Using a mean-field theory{,} we predict that the front emerges where the curvature of the elasticity profile is large and that it propagates diffusively. This elastic ripening can occur at much higher rates than classical Ostwald ripening{,} thus driving the dynamics. Our work shows how gradients in elastic properties control the arrangement of droplets{,} which has potential applications in soft matter physics and biological cells."}

    abstract = { Biomolecular condensates are small droplets forming spontaneously in biological cells through phase separation. They play a role in many cellular processes, but it is unclear how cells control them. Cellular regulation often relies on post-translational modifications of proteins. For biomolecular condensates, such chemical modifications could alter the molecular interaction of key condensate components. Here, we test this idea using a theoretical model based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In particular, we describe the chemical reactions using transition-state theory, which accounts for the non-ideality of phase separation. We identify that fast control, as in cell signalling, is only possible when external energy input drives the reaction out of equilibrium. If this reaction differs inside and outside the droplet, it is even possible to control droplet sizes. Such an imbalance in the reaction could be created by enzymes localizing to the droplet. Since this situation is typical inside cells, we speculate that our proposed mechanism is used to stabilize multiple droplets with independently controlled size and count. Our model provides a novel and thermodynamically consistent framework for describing droplets subject to non-equilibrium chemical reactions. }

abstract={Summary Malignant transformation is characterized by dysregulation of diverse cellular processes that have been the subject of detailed genetic, biochemical, and structural studies, but only recently has evidence emerged that many of these processes occur in the context of biomolecular condensates. Condensates are membrane-less bodies, often formed by liquid-liquid phase separation, that compartmentalize protein and RNA molecules with related functions. New insights from condensate studies portend a profound transformation in our understanding of cellular dysregulation in cancer. Here we summarize key features of biomolecular condensates, note where they have been implicated---or will likely be implicated---in oncogenesis, describe evidence that the pharmacodynamics of cancer therapeutics can be greatly influenced by condensates, and discuss some of the questions that must be addressed to further advance our understanding and treatment of cancer.},
